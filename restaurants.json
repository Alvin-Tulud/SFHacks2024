I had to ask if we were to seat ourselves before anyone acknowledged us being there.\nAfter we sat down and finally placed our orders, our beverages were brought out.\nDespite us informing our server that there were drinks missing, we never received them.\nAfter waiting on our order for 30-45 minutes if not longer , we inquired on our order.\nWe were informed that our order would be out in 8 minutes.  After about 5 minutes of receiving that information we were told that our food would be out in 10 minutes.\nNeedless to say we canceled our order, paid for the drinks that we received even though we did not drink them and left the restaurant.\nNo apology from the Manager on duty.",

A couple of menu items caught my eye and I decided to give SaltYard a try. I am extremely happy I did. As usual,  I sat at the end of the bar and was greeted by a pleasant young bartender named Dodo who seemed generally pleased to be there. He made an excellent drink and was very attentive to the entire bar. His smile, happy attitude, and respectful service was infectious. I went with the Ceasar salad to start. It was good. What was better was when half way through the bartender asked to let me know when I was ready for my main course. Too many restaurants lately want to turn seats or be done near the end of the night. Here, I was able to take my time and take a pause before my main. I could have just as easily asked him for it quickly, but he graciously allowed me to choose my speed. I went with the seafood risotto which was excellent!! He suggested the house made Sticky Toffee for dessert which paired great with a Port. Again, excellent!! I will definitely visit again next time I am in town.",

The drinks were great. Always love checking out the kind of concoction they make for cocktails. Truffle fries were great. Wished the truffle ravioli had more truffle flavor. The seafood on the pasta and the risotta had large shrimp and other seafood but I prefer fresher seafood. Cesar salad was good but some more anchovies would have made it perfect. Cheesecake and chocolate lava cake were moist and tasty. The sugar in the creme Brulee was great. Great ambiance and nice Street\u00a0to\u00a0walk\u00a0around.",

The orders get filled up typically within 10 minutes or so. Our party of 4 has no difficulty finding a table. The Nacho with toppings was good. As were the chalupas and soft tacos. I may come back for breakfast just to check out what they serve.",
            "Well, since I went In and had no communication with any employees because it's just a bunch of screens that scream out welcome to the future of Taco Bell. Use the computer screen to order yourself and pay and then we will hand you your food if you can complete this task on your own. A little bit irritating. Because fast food workers are making what? $15 to $20 bucks an hour. They actually get paid to be trained for the job. So the way I see it. I spent like $25 bucks. I should receive a discount for my wage at least. So my total should have been $5 bucks. Now on the plus side by me placing my own order I didn't hear, \"We don't serve that anymore.\" and for the first time in a very long time, my order was actually correct. I think I have a real future here. Lol. I'm waiting to walk in next and have them tell me I have to cool my food as well. I just really think if you're having me do your job, Taco Bell! at least pass on.

The place was chaotic, and it was clear from the get-go that my burger might take a while. Sure enough, after a 20-minute wait filled with mix-ups and forgotten orders, mine finally made it to me. But the disappointment was just beginning.\n\nThe bun on my Quarter Pounder was inexplicably soggy, as though it had soaked up all the humidity in the room, and the patty was a sad sight: overcooked yet somehow still lukewarm. The cheese, which I had been looking forward to, hadn't even properly melted and just sat there, cold and uninviting. To top it off, the fries were just as lackluster - lukewarm and barely seasoned.\n\nIt was a meal that somehow managed to be both unremarkable and entirely unforgettable, for all the wrong reasons.

We followed the waiters suggestion on the recommended doneness and it was really good.

This is the best Arabic food in the bay area hands down, it's a must try place. The only place that has stews that you will never find anywhere else. The service is great, the owners are very nice, the atmosphere is calm and elegant ,and the energy is beautiful. I would go every day if I could. The prices are very reasonable for the high quality food.",
            "The lamb shank was excellent.  The taboulleh was great and in the style that favors parsley.  The dolma was fresh and moist with a hint of red pepper.  Overall, really good Middle Eastern food - coming from someone that grew up with these foods.",
            "Perfect middle eastern cuisine. We found it completely unexpected. The food is very well prepared. I hope to come back soon.",
            "Food was amazing best food I got in Bay Area, service was great too. Definitely will go again",
            "Awesome food with really authentic flavors. Service can be a bit slow but I don't mind that for the quality of the food.\nIf the restaurant was a little more upbeat or maybe played Lebanese music I would come here all the time. I ordered the semak harra (spicy fish) and it was really awesome - not too spicy at all!"

            "We\u2019ve been coming to this particular Crepevine Restaurant for quite a few years.  We have never had a bad meal or a bad experience here.  All the food is freshly prepared and delicious!  Most of the dishes come in large portions, and many people end up taking food home with them.  The way this restaurant is laid out, keeps wait times down to a minimum during the busy hours.  No reservations, just show up, order and be seated.  Food comes very quickly.  The restaurant staff are extremely friendly, helpful and efficient.  There are many items to choose from on their unique menu board, so you can easily pick something different each time you visit.  Highly recommend the Crepevine for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you are on or near Burlingame Avenue.",
            "We tried Crepevine for dinner in Burlingame because we liked the one in Mountain View already. Technically, they\u2019re the same because they\u2019re chain restaurants. Same menu, same atmosphere.\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. The food and drink came fast. To be honest, we just paid and were looking for a table. When we found one, the drink was ready and the waitress came to us (I was holding the number) and asked \u201cyou guys ordered lemonade?\u201d. I said \u2018yes\u2019 and pointed to the available table. After that, the food came out in less than 5 minutes.\nBig portion food. Both my husband and I struggled to finish our dishes. We both thought we over ordered them.\nWe ordered one Thai savory crepe, one Capri pasta, one Clam chowder soup and Lemonade. Good quality food though.",
            "Loved this place. If I wasn't traveling through and I lived there I'd for sure visit again. Loved the whole vibe of not only the restaurant but the outside decor of this whole area. Think it was called Burlingame",
            "It was a busy place, but they were quick getting us in and out. The food portions were huge and they were delicious. Would definitely eat here again.",
            "This is one of my favorite spots in burlingame for casual dining.   The food is flavourful. Good size servings. A great variety of food with fresh juices options and drinks."

            "I went there with my family on a Tuesday night. I noticed the restaurant was under staff (its the holiday season) and food was ok. The pork was greasy and over breaded. The Caprese salad was presented cute but not enough tomato and arugula. The tomato or Mariana sauce was good. The elderberry martini had a kick but it was delicious if you like something new. The dessert was the best part: bread pudding, gelato and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They sold out of tiramisu that day.",
            "We had our Italian family gathering at La Lanterna on a Sunday afternoon. They opened specially for our event. I had made all the arrangements in advance with Michael, including the menu. The event went off perfectly and flawlessly. The food, from the appetizers to the deserts was outstanding, especially the gnocchi. This restaurant is a perfect place to have a special event! And there is no charge for the room.",
            "My mom and I like to have girl dates here and love the food and wait staff. Michael and the rest of the team are incredibly kind and always make us feel welcome. I have loved every plate we ordered and the deserts are just as good. I definitely recommend this place.",
            "Highly recommended. I have dined there dozens of times. It is always a great experience.\nHigh grades for both food (try the cannelloni) and the very friendly service.\n\nThe cannelloni and Caesar salad are so good, I have a hard time ordering anything else!",
            "The service is impeccable. The food tastes great to me. Very authentic Italian as I was told by friends. But I wouldn't know. The desert selection is pretty great. We work next door and pretty much eat here a few days a week. Still not tired of it."

            "The place had beautiful stained glass all over, loved the vibe! There weren't too many people on a Thursday evening. My friend and I ordered enchiladas, they were really good. We were surprised that we were able to finish our portions. Tortilla chips were super hard and we didn't end up having any! The server was very kind and patient \u2728",
            "This is a busy family run restaurant. Make a reservation  during peak times is my suggestion. The service is super friendly and fast and they make you feel special. The ambiance is warm, vibrant and reminds of Mexican hacienda. The servings are generous. The food overall is well presented and tasty. Yup, try this restaurant. You will like it.",
            "Has amazing food and I have had a great share of Mexican restaurants.  Margaritas are a little strong but the food was great.  If I can ask someone there I\u2019m not from the area I would like to know the ingredients of the salad that comes with the burrito you order.",
            "Very flavorful.\nA good balance between not so fatty, but not dry.",
            "Super cute Mexican restaurant with probably the nicest waitress I've ever had. Everything we ordered was delicious. Chips were thick and extra crunchy."

            "Stepped into tastee grill and was greeted with the most vibrant plate of falafel I've ever laid eyes on!

The rice was good and Falafel is 7 not more than that..\nThe owner proposed me immediately compensation a plate of Hummus\nSo as i said.. very kind and fair but the food must improve..\nI think the place got new branding ..\u201dTastee Grill\u201d",

            "From its clean and parking-friendly atmosphere to its accommodating seating arrangements, the restaurant set the stage for an enjoyable meal.\n\nOne aspect that particularly impressed me was the diverse menu options catering to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. My party and I sampled a variety of dishes, including the falafel, butcher's cut lamb koftedes, chicken gyro platter, and baba ganush. Each dish was expertly prepared, bursting with flavor, and beautifully presented.\n\nFurthermore, it was reassuring to note that all meat served at the restaurant is halal, ensuring inclusivity for guests with dietary preferences.\n\nIn addition to the culinary delights, the pricing was reasonable, offering excellent value for the quality of food and service provided.",
            "Would definitely come back. Had sangria, wine, cheese and mushrooms pide, Appetizer sampler platter. Food was good and service was great too. You need to pair the Appetizer with something to dip and enjoy with. Do visit if you are near by and love some Mediterranean food \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Very clean establishment. Ordered the Hummus flight that has all four of the homemade hummus flavors (classic, olive&feta, beet, and chipotle). All were very good - the Chipotle has a mild kick that gets stronger on the palate as you enjoy it!! And very good Turkish coffee, offered with or without sweetening. Very pleased! Very pleasant staff.",
            "We came here a few times for lunch / dinner. You order first and then they give you a number which you can bring to your table. It might take a while for them to bring you the food but it\u2019s worth it.\n\nThe meat here is so fresh! We got the combo plate and the red lentil soup. The combo plate has beef kabob, chicken kabob, kofte meatball and lamb and beef gyro. The meat is usually very fresh and the sauces are delicious. The red lentil soup is average at best, it was quite bland and I had to add a bit of salt to make it taste okay.\nEach item came with two pieces of pita bread as well.",
            "The staff is very friendly and informative. We ordered the appetizer platter and the meat combo. All tasted delicious. Everything on the appetizer platter tasted fresh and perfect for someone who wants to try everything on the menu."

We had to wait another 20 minutes upon arrival.  The Food Order was 6 PUPUSAS  well toasted. I will make the same orde at AMERICAN HOUSE to see if they can Satisfy a Customer .",

            "I've been here 2-3 times in the past and this place by far has the most delicious pupusas in San Mateo. Most places skimp on the filling, not these guys, the filling just oozes out begging to be enjoyed \ud83e\udd17\n\nHad the atol de elote and it was nothing special. This review is only based on the pupusas.",
